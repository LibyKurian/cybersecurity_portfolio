‚úîÔ∏è CEH Knowledge Exam (Multiple Choice) ‚Äì Tests theoretical understanding of hacking techniques  
‚úîÔ∏è CEH Practical Exam (6-Hour Challenge) ‚Äì Requires solving real-world security challenges  

### You'll Learn:
- Advanced hacking techniques and penetration testing methodologies
- Hands-on experience with real-world cyberattacks and exploitations
- How to bypass security defenses and strengthen security postures
- Red teaming and post-exploitation tactics used by ethical hackers

### Syllabus & Topics Covered:
1. **Advanced Reconnaissance & Footprinting**
2. **Deep Network Scanning & Enumeration**
3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities & Privilege Escalation**
4. **Malware Development & Reverse Engineering Basics**
5. **Packet Sniffing, Spoofing & MITM Attacks**
6. **Advanced Social Engineering Attacks**
7. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Distributed DoS (DDoS) Attacks**
8. **Session Hijacking & Web App Exploits**
9. **Database Attacks (SQL Injection, NoSQL Exploits)**
10. **Wireless Network Attacks & Exploit Development**
11. **Evading IDS, Firewalls & Security Controls**
12. **Cloud Security Exploitation & Hardening**
13. **Cryptography Attacks & Steganography**
14. **Red Teaming & Active Directory Attacks**
15. **IoT & OT Security Vulnerabilities**
